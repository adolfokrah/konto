# 🇬🇭 Testing Real SMS with Ghana Numbers

## ⏰ Current Status: Rate Limited

**Issue**: "Too many requests" after Blaze upgrade
**Solution**: Wait 30 minutes, then test again

## 🧪 Testing Protocol

### **Step 1: Wait Period** ⏳
- **Current time**: Check your last attempt
- **Wait until**: 30 minutes after last request
- **Why**: Firebase rate limits reset automatically

### **Step 2: Test Real Ghana Number** 🇬🇭
```bash
# Run the app
flutter run

# Use this number:
Phone: +233 245301631
Expected: Real SMS to your Ghana phone! 📱
```

### **Step 3: Verify SMS Reception** ✅
- **Check your Ghana phone**: Should receive real SMS
- **SMS content**: 6-digit verification code
- **Timing**: Usually arrives within 10-30 seconds

### **Step 4: Complete Verification** 🎯
- **Enter the code**: From your real SMS
- **Expected result**: Login successful!
- **Navigation**: Should go to home screen

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **If "Too Many Requests" Again:**
```
Solution 1: Wait another 15 minutes
Solution 2: Try different Ghana number (+233 xxx xxx xxx)
Solution 3: Test with Firebase test number first
```

### **If No SMS Received:**
```
Check 1: Phone has signal/data
Check 2: Number format is +233245301631 (no spaces)
Check 3: Firebase Console → Authentication → Events
Check 4: SMS not in spam/blocked messages
```

### **If SMS Takes Long:**
```
Normal: 10-30 seconds
Delayed: Up to 2 minutes (network issues)
Failed: No SMS after 5 minutes = retry
```

## 📊 Firebase Console Verification

### **Check Authentication Events:**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Authentication → Events
3. Look for:
   - ✅ "Phone verification started"
   - ✅ "SMS sent successfully"
   - ✅ "User signed in"

### **Check SMS Usage:**
1. Go to Usage and Billing
2. Look for SMS usage counter
3. Should increment after successful send

## 🎯 Success Indicators

### **✅ Everything Working When:**
- Ghana number receives real SMS
- 6-digit code works for login
- No rate limiting errors
- Firebase events show success
- User navigates to home screen

### **🚨 Still Issues If:**
- Persistent "too many requests"
- No SMS after 5 minutes
- Invalid verification code errors
- Firebase events show failures

## 🇬🇭 Ghana Network Compatibility

### **Supported Networks:**
- ✅ MTN Ghana
- ✅ Vodafone Ghana  
- ✅ AirtelTigo Ghana

### **Expected Delivery Times:**
- **MTN**: 10-30 seconds

## 🔄 Development vs Production

### **For Continued Development:**
```
Primary: Use test numbers (+1 650-555-3434, code: 654321)
Occasional: Test real Ghana numbers
Production: Users won't hit rate limits with normal usage
```

### **Rate Limit Guidelines:**
```
Development: Test numbers = unlimited
Real numbers: ~5 attempts per day per number
Per device: ~10 attempts per hour
Team testing: Coordinate number usage
```
